## Prerequisites
- Git installed
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB running locally (default at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`)
- (Optional) GitHub account if pushing repo

---

## Quick setup (Windows / PowerShell)
1. Open PowerShell and go to project folder:
2. Install dependencies
3. Start local MongoDB (if not running). Example (for installed service):
- Run `mongod` or ensure MongoDB service is started via Services.

4. Seed the database (if you have `init/index.js` or `init/index1.js`):- The seed script should connect to MongoDB, normalize `Img` to a string and insert sample listings. Check console logs for success.

5. Start the app from project root:- Visit http://localhost:3000

## Environment/configuration
- MongoDB URL is configured in `app.js` / `init/index.js`:
  ```js
  const Mongo_url = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/rooms';
